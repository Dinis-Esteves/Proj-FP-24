# Fundamentos da Programação Course Repository

This repository contains all the coursework completed during the FP Course (Fundamentos da Programação - EN: Programming Foundations).

## Projects Overview 
### **Project 1: Basic Implementation**

The [first project](Project_1) primarily focused on implementing foundational concepts that were necessary for subsequent projects. It served as a preparatory exercise for the more complex tasks ahead.

### **Project 2: Go Terminal Game**

The [second project](Project_2) involved the development of a terminal-based game using the Go programming language. This project presented significant challenges, including debugging issues that, unfortunately, couldn't be addressed due to time constraints.

## Technologies Used:

Both projects were implemented using Python without any external imports or class implementations.
